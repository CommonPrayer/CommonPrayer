# Common Prayer Project

The purpose of the Common Prayer project is to create tools that help bring Christians together in worship, prayer, and the reading of scripture.

The initial focus will be digitizing The Episcopal Church's 1979 version of the Book of Common Prayer. Additional prayer books may be included in the future.

# Traditional Form, Modern Application

The philosophy of the Common Prayer project is to take the most essential content and forms of worship, prayer, and scripture reading and make them easily usable and accessible for churches, families, and individuals.

# Roadmap
